emacs: Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
emacs: display editor. If this seems to be a bit of a mouthful, an easier
emacs: explanation is that Emacs is a text editor and more. At its core is an
emacs: interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language
emacs: with extensions to support text editing.
